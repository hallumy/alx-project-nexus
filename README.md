🛒 E-Commerce Backend
Real-World Backend Engineering Application

This project simulates a real-world backend development environment focused on building a scalable, secure, and performant backend system for an e-commerce platform. It mirrors the workflows, challenges, and expectations of professional backend engineering teams.

📘 Overview

The E-Commerce Backend provides a robust API that powers an online product catalog. It includes secure user authentication, efficient product management, and advanced API features such as filtering, sorting, and pagination.

This case study prepares backend engineers to build production-ready systems using modern best practices.

🎯 Project Goals
1. CRUD APIs

Full CRUD support for:

Products

Categories

User accounts

JWT-based secure authentication & authorization.

2. Efficient Product Discovery

Filtering (category, price range, availability)

Sorting (price, date added, name)

Pagination (optimized for large datasets)

3. Database Optimization

Scalable relational schema design (PostgreSQL)

Query optimization and indexing for high-performance search

Real-world database structure design principles
